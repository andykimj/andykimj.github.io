I’m a third-year medical student at the University of Massachusetts T.H. Chan School of Medicine. I'm currently in the process of deciding what medical specialty I will pursue after medical school. I'm also currently seeking projects in quality improvement and clinical research, so please reach out if you would like to connect!

I was born in Seoul, South Korea and was raised in various suburbs outside of Toronto, Ontario. I graduated from Emory University with a Bachelor of Science in Physics and then worked in business management in the corporate offices of a large [retailer](https://corporate.walmart.com/) in Silicon Valley. Prior to medical school, I conducted clinical research in transplant infectious diseases and COVID-19 [therapeutics](https://www.wcvb.com/article/boston-researchers-significant-paxlovid-benefit-covid-19-vaccinated-patients/42220461) and [diagnostics](https://testboston.org/) at Brigham and Women's Hospital, a Harvard-affiliated institution.

Outside of work, you’ll find me playing [chess](https://andykimj.com/chess/), reading, or watching sports with friends.
